        <h2>Persistent noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active
          matter</h2>
        <p style="width: 640px;">Chirality and activity lead to non-reciprocal
          transverse interaction between neighboring particles. Then peculiar
          elasticity emerges, where stress and strain that were independent in
          regular matter become coupled; compression causes spontaneous rotation
          of the material, for example. This elasticity is called "odd
          elasticity" because it is represented by off-diagonal asymmetric
          elements in the elastic modulus tensor. Although odd elastic waves are
          predicted to exist, they are always damped, which makes them difficult
          to experimentally observe. Inspired by the works on fluctuation-driven
          pattern formations in population dynamics, we generate persistent odd
          elastic waves driven by noise due to self-propulsion. We focus on the
          model of starfish embryos <em>Patiria miniata</em>, which form a
          living crystal during a certain stage of their development. This
          living crystal has been experimentally shown to be odd-elastic. By
          adding the noise from collision between neighbors due to
          self-propulsion, which has been neglected in previous works, we
          demonstrate that the wave persists even in the presence of damping.
          With the spectral method using current correlation functions, we also
          show that the oscillatory behavior reported in the living crystal of
          starfish embryos is due to the self-circling motion from combination
          of self-spinning and self-propulsion of the embryos, rather than a
          wave. Our derivation of the new criterion for persistent noise-driven
          odd elastic wave suggests that strong enough, but not too strong,
          noise and transverse force relative to longitudinal force are needed
          for the persistent wave. Although our work focuses on the starfish
          embryos, our framework is general and is applicable to other chiral
          active systems.</p>

        <h2>The scaling behavior in honeybee and human social interaction<span style="color: #339999;"><span
              style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;;"> </span></span></h2>
        <p style="width: 640px;">Burstiness of an inter-event time distribution
          has been much studied because of its relation to information or
          disease spreading. On the other hand, the distribution of contact
          duration has received less attention. We measured the duration of
          honeybee trophallaxis, or mouth-to-mouth liquid food transfer, and
          face-to-face encounters by using high-resolution tracking in
          collaboration with <a href="https://www.life.illinois.edu/robinson/" target="_blank">Robinson
            Lab</a> in the University of Illinois and found out that the
          distribution of event durations is heavy-tailed. Human data recorded
          by the <a href="http://www.sociopatterns.org/" target="_blank">SocioPatterns</a>
          collaboration show that human face-to-face interactions in various
          settings also exhibit a heavy-tailed interaction time distribution.
          Such similarity across different systems suggests unexpected
          universality in social interactions. We have derived the power-law
          form by building a minimal model that treats the termination of an
          interaction as a particle escaping over an energy barrier; the
          variability in the population leads to a distribution of energy
          barriers which is determined by the extreme value theory and is a key
          to achieving the final power-law form. Honeybees indeed exhibit
          individual differences in interactivity although they are less
          different than humans. Our work demonstrates how individual
          differences can lead to universal patterns of social interaction that
          transcend species, context and specific mechanisms. </p>
